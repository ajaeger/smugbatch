Patches are gladly accepted for smugbatch code, please send them to
greg@kroah.com, or you can use github to send a pull request.

The code tree for smubatch is located at:
	http://github.com/gregkh/smugbatch
and can be cloned using git from:
	git://github.com/gregkh/smugbatch.git

If you have never used git before, there are some useful tutorials on
the github.com web site to help you through the learning process.

I am trying to follow the Linux kernel coding style with the code
whereever possible.  This style is documented in the Linux kernel source
tree in the file Documentation/CodingStyle.  Included in the smugbatch
code tree is a script called checkpatch.pl that can automatically check
if your changes are compliant with the guidelines.

To test this, using git, generate a patch:
	git diff > my_patch
Then run checkpatch.pl against this patch:
	./scripts/checkpatch.pl --no-tree my_patch
