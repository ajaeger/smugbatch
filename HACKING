Patches are gladly accepted for smugbatch code, please send them to
greg@kroah.com, or you can use github to send a pull request.

The code tree for smubatch is located at:
	http://github.com/gregkh/smugbatch
and can be cloned using git from:
	git://github.com/gregkh/smugbatch.git

If you have never used git before, there are some useful tutorials on
the github.com web site to help you through the learning process.

I am trying to follow the Linux kernel coding style with the code
whereever possible.  This style is documented in the Linux kernel source
tree in the file Documentation/CodingStyle.  Included in the smugbatch
code tree is a script called checkpatch.pl that can automatically check
if your changes are compliant with the guidelines.

To test this, using git, generate a patch:
	git diff > my_patch
Then run checkpatch.pl against this patch:
	./scripts/checkpatch.pl --no-tree my_patch


Please run your modifications through valgrind if possible.  A number of
functions within smug_core.c return strings that must be freed by the caller.
Hopefully most of these functions are properly marked, but valgrind can easily
check this to ensure you are properly cleaning up.

It is safe to ignore the valgrind errors in the curl and ssl libraries, we
can't do anything about those at this time.
