smugbatch - a collection of command line tools for interacting with
	    smugmug.com

This collection of tools allows you to list, upload, and download images
from smugmug.com from a command line.  They are for use with Linux systems
and hopefully should be able to be easily called by other tools to interact
with smugmug.com where needed.

Any questions, contact Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>

For tips on helping out with development of the codebase, see the file,
HACKING.
